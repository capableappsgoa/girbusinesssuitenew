# Form Focus Fix - Titlebar Removal

## Problem
The custom titlebar was causing focus glitching issues in forms throughout the application. Users experienced:
- Forms losing focus when clicked
- Cursor jumping between form fields
- Inconsistent focus behavior
- General form interaction problems

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Titlebar Completely
- Deleted `public/titlebar.js` file
- Removed titlebar injection from `public/electron.js`
- Removed focus management scripts that were causing conflicts

### 2. Cleaned Up Preload Script
- Removed focus management functions from `public/preload.js`
- Removed window focus event listeners
- Kept only essential window control functions

### 3. Updated CSS
- Added proper form focus styles in `src/app/globals.css`
- Removed titlebar-related padding
- Added smooth transitions for form elements

### 4. Created Optional Window Controls
- Created `src/components/common/WindowControls.js` as an optional component
- Can be imported and used in specific pages if needed
- Doesn't interfere with form focus

## Benefits
- ✅ Forms now work smoothly without focus glitching
- ✅ Clean, native window behavior
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ No more cursor jumping issues
- ✅ Consistent form interaction

## Optional Window Controls
If you want window controls in specific areas, you can import and use the `WindowControls` component:

```jsx
import WindowControls from '../components/common/WindowControls';

// In your component
<WindowControls />
```

## Testing
The application now has:
- Smooth form focus behavior
- No interference from custom titlebar
- Native window controls (minimize, maximize, close)
- Better overall user experience

The focus issues should be completely resolved!
