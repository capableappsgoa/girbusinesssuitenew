# Comprehensive Form Focus Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing severe focus glitching issues in forms, especially when loading from remote URLs. Users experienced:
- Forms losing focus when clicked
- Cursor jumping between form fields
- Inconsistent focus behavior
- Focus being stolen by other elements
- General form interaction problems

## Root Cause Analysis
The issues were caused by:
1. **Remote URL Loading**: Loading from `https://girbusinesssuitenew.vercel.app/` introduced conflicts
2. **Electron Focus Management**: Electron's default focus behavior was interfering
3. **Event Propagation**: Global event handlers were stealing focus
4. **Dynamic Content**: New form elements weren't getting proper focus handlers

## Comprehensive Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced Electron Configuration
- Added comprehensive focus management scripts
- Disabled features that interfere with focus (`Auxclick`, `autoplayPolicy`)
- Added proper window options (`focusable`, `autoHideMenuBar`)
- Implemented focus state tracking

### 2. Advanced Focus Management Script
- **Global Focus State**: Tracks `isFocusLocked` and `lastFocusedElement`
- **Event Capture**: Uses capture phase to prevent interference
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear focus indicators with blue outline
- **Dynamic Content**: Watches for new form elements and applies handlers
- **Focus Restoration**: Remembers and restores focus after window events

### 3. Aggressive CSS Overrides
- Force proper focus behavior with `!important` rules
- Prevent focus stealing with `pointer-events` management
- Ensure proper cursor behavior
- Override any conflicting styles from remote app

### 4. URL Strategy
- **Development**: Uses `http://localhost:3000` for better control
- **Production**: Uses remote URL with comprehensive focus management

## Testing
The application now includes:

## Debug Information
When you open the DevTools console, you'll see:

This helps verify that the focus management is working correctly.
